	\section*{Introduction}

		\textbf{Sudoku} is a placement puzzle, also known as Number Place in the U.S.A.
		\newline
		The game consists most frequently of a 9 x 9 grid, divided in 9 subgrids with dimension 3 x 3 called ``regions".
		\newline
		The purpose is to enter a digit from 1 to 9 (or other symbols e.g. letters, icons) in each cell of the grid so that each row, column and region contains only one instance of each digit.
		\newline
		We implemented a \textbf{SAT solver} (instead of combining backtracking and methods for constraint propagation as other Sudoku solver) to figure out a correct solution for the Sudoku.
		\newline
		Basically the Sudoku is translated into a propositional formula that can be satisfied only if the Sudoku has a solution.
		\newline
		Once the propositional formula is generated, the SAT solver tries to find a satisfying assignment that will become the solution for the original Sudoku.

	\section*{Reduces Sudoku problem to a SAT clause}


	Digits are modelled by a datatype with nine elements $(1, . . , 9)$.
	\newline
	We can say that the grid cells $(x1, . . , x9)$ are valid if they contain
	at least and at most 1 digit each.
	\subsubsection*{Definition 1}
		\[ \operatorname{valid}\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}, x_{5}, x_{6}, x_{7}, x_{8}, x_{9}\right) \equiv \bigwedge_{d=1}^{9} \bigvee_{i=1}^{9} x_{i}=d \]
	Labeling the 81 cells, we can check if the cells generate a correct solution for the Sudoku puzzle.

	\subsubsection*{Sudoku definition}
	\[\operatorname{sudoku}\left(\left\{x_{i j}\right\}_{i, j \in\{1, \ldots, 9\}}\right) \equiv \bigwedge_{i=1}^{9} \operatorname{valid}\left(x_{i 1}, x_{i 2}, x_{i 3}, x_{i 4}, x_{i 5}, x_{i 6}, x_{i 7}, x_{i 8}, x_{i 9}\right)\]

	\[ \wedge \bigwedge_{j=1}^{9} \operatorname{valid}\left(x_{1 j}, x_{2 j}, x_{3 j}, x_{4 j}, x_{5 j}, x_{6 j}, x_{7 j}, x_{8 j}, x_{9 j}\right)\]

	\[ \wedge \bigwedge_{i, j \in\{1,4\}} \operatorname{valid}\left(x_{i j}, x_{i(j+1)}, x_{i(j+2)}, x_{(i+1) j}, x_{(i+1)(j+1)}, x_{(i+1)(j+2),}\right.\]

	\[ x_{(i+2) j}, x_{(i+2)(j+1)}, x_{(i+2)(j+2)} )\]

	\section*{SAT Solver}
	We're now introducing 9 boolean variables for each cell of the 9x9 grid in order to encode a Sudoku.
	\newline
	Each boolean value holds the truth value of the equation x$_{i,j}$ = d.
	\newline A clause \[\bigvee_{d=1}^{9} p_{i j}^{d}\] assures that a cell contains one of the nine accepted digits, whilst 36 clauses
	\newline
	\[\bigwedge_{1 \leq d<d^{\prime} \leq 9} \neg p_{i j}^{d} \vee \neg p_{i j}^{d^{\prime}} \]
	assure that a cell doesn't hold two different digits.
	\newline
	Since the number of digits is equal to the number of cells in every row, column or region, then the nine grid cells (x$_1$, ..., x$_9$) hold distinct values.
	\newline
	\subsubsection*{Lemma 1} \\
	\[\operatorname{valid}\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}, x_{5}, x_{6}, x_{7}, x_{8}, x_{9}\right) \Longleftrightarrow \bigwedge_{1 \leq i<j \leq 9} x_{i} \neq x_{j}\]
	\[\Longleftrightarrow \bigwedge_{1 \leq i<j \leq 9} \bigwedge_{d=1}^{9} x_{i} \neq d \vee x_{j} \neq d\]
	\newline
The given formula, when converted into \texttt{SAT}, is translated into 9 clauses * 36 inequations = 324 clauses, each of length 2. This allows more unit propagation at the boolean level than what was previously stated in \textbf{Def. 1}, which gives us the possibility of cross hatching digits (a technique used in Sudoku to reduce the search space).
\newline
Summarising, up to now, our \texttt{SAT} is composed of:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 81 definedness clauses of length 9
		\item 81 $\cdot$ 36 uniqueness clauses of length 2
		\item 27 $\cdot$ 324 validity clauses of length 2
	\end{enumerate}
For a total of \textbf{11745} clauses.
\newline
Since we know a priori the value of some cells (user input), we can just add these condition to our clause list.
\newline
Finally, our encoding produces a propositional formula already in \texttt{CNF}, so the conversion into \texttt{DIMACS CNF} (the input format for most sat solvers) is trivial.
