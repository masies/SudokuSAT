	\section*{Introduction}
	
		\textbf{Sudoku} is a placement puzzle, also known as Number Place in the U.S.A.
		\newline
		The game consists most frequently of a 9 x 9 grid, divided in 9 subgrids with dimension 3 x 3 called ``regions".
		\newline
		The purpose is to enter a digit from 1 to 9 (or other symbols e.g. letters, icons) in each cell of the grid so that each row, column and region contains only one instance of each digit.
		\newline
		We implemented a \textbf{SAT solver} (Instead of combine backtracking and methods for constraint propagation as other Sudoku solver) to figured out a correct solution for the Sudoku.
		\newline
		Basically the Sudoku is translated into a propositional formula that can be satify only if the Sudoku has a solution.
		\newline
		Once the propositional formula is formulated, The SAT solver tries to find a satisfying assignment that will become the solution for the original Sudoku.
